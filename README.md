XControls
=========

JavaFX extensions which provide sophisticated PropertyList, TreeView, and other components with data models that do real-time inter-Node updates based on dependencies between the underlying properties. Underlying data model is independent of view and can be switched between different view layouts, including list, tree, and grid or graph. I plan to add drag and drop layout capabilities and local and online DataSource mapping to underlying real-time data models. What I have in this repository so far, 08-02-2014, is a preliminary sample implementation of XComponents, i.e. a demo of the components.
